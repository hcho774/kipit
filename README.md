## Inspiration

The inspiration for Kipit comes from my personal struggles when I managed the entire inventories of the hotel with old school excel sheets. Even though we had a well knwon Property Management System with inventory function included, nobody was bothered to use it because it was too outdated and not user friendly at all. I wanted to develop an inventory system that is easy and simple to use for all users who would like to keep track of not only office supplies and company assets but also personal belongings at home.
